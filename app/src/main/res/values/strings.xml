    <string name="Ingredients">• 500g chicken (cut into pieces)\n• 2 cups basmati rice (soaked 30 mins)\n• 1 large onion (finely sliced)\n• 2 tomatoes (chopped)\n• 1/2 cup yogurt\n• 3 green chilies (slit)\n• 1/4 cup mint leaves (chopped)\n• 1/4 cup coriander leaves (chopped)\n• 1 tsp ginger-garlic paste\n• 1 tsp chili powder\n• 1 tsp turmeric powder\n• 1 tsp garam masala\n• 2 bay leaves\n• 4 cloves\n• 1 cinnamon stick\n• Salt to taste\n• 2 tbsp vegetable oil\n• Saffron strands (soaked in 2 tbsp warm milk)</string>
    <string name="Instructions">Step 1: Rinse basmati rice and soak in water for 30 minutes. Drain before use.\n\nStep 2: Marinate chicken with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, salt, and half of the chopped mint and coriander. Let it rest for 30 minutes.\n\nStep 3: Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pot. Add bay leaves, cloves, and cinnamon stick. Sauté for 30 seconds to release aroma.\n\nStep 4: Add sliced onions and cook until golden brown. Add chopped tomatoes and green chilies. Cook until soft and oil separates.\n\nStep 5: Add marinated chicken and cook on medium heat for 15–20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until chicken is tender and spices are well blended.\n\nStep 6: In a separate pot, boil water with a pinch of salt and turmeric. Parboil the soaked rice for 5–7 minutes until 70% cooked. Drain and set aside.\n\nStep 7: Layer the biryani: Spread half of the chicken mixture at the bottom of the pot. Add half of the parboiled rice on top. Drizzle saffron milk and some mint and coriander leaves. Repeat layers.\n\nStep 8: Cover with a tight lid or seal with foil and dough. Cook on low heat (dum) for 20–25 minutes to let flavors blend.\n\nStep 9: Gently fluff the biryani with a fork. Serve hot with papadum, raita, or salad.</string>
